sequenceDiagram

    %% Participants involved in the flow
    participant User
    participant API as Presentation Layer (API)
    participant BusinessLogic as Business Logic Layer (Place Model)
    participant Database as Persistence Layer (Database)

    %% Step 1: User submits data to create a new Place
    %% Input includes fields required by the business rules
    User->>API: POST /places\n{name, location, price, amenities}

    %% Step 2: API passes data to the business logic layer for validation
    %% Ensures data integrity before proceeding with creation
    API->>BusinessLogic: validatePlaceData(name, location, price)

    %% Step 3: Business logic confirms data is valid
    %% If validation fails, this flow stops and error is returned (not shown here)
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Validation Success

    %% Step 4: API calls logic layer to create the Place
    %% User ID is passed to associate the Place with its owner
    API->>BusinessLogic: createPlace(user_id, name, location, price, amenities)

    %% Step 5: Business logic inserts the Place into the database
    %% Timestamp is recorded for auditing
    BusinessLogic->>Database: INSERT INTO places\n(name, location, price, user_id, created_at)

    %% Step 6: DB confirms the new Place record has been created
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: Place Created

    %% Step 7: Business logic prepares and sends response to API
    %% This can include the new place ID and other metadata
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Success Response

    %% Step 8: API returns the result to the user
    %% Response follows REST convention with HTTP 201 and basic place info
    API-->>User: 201 Created\n{place_id, name, location, price}
